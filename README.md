# vocheck

vocheck is a new tool for teachers and pupils to easily check and do vocabulary homework.
Teachers can create vocabulary lists for homework and the students can do their homework online.

**The problem is learning the vocabularies**
Learning vocabularies as a homework is always a difficult business for all parties. On the one
hand, pupils do not want to learn vocabularies from the book or getting in an awkward situation when the parents are testing vocabularies. Pupils prefer to learn the vocabularies on their own if it is not completely boring.
On the other hand, parents have to spend time in testing the vocabularies of their children if they have to learn it from the book. If you have more than one child, you must spend a lot of time.
Additionally, there are the teachers who have no control if the pupils have learned the vocabularies. Therefore, teachers must write a Lot of tests to check if they did their homework or they have to test them in front of the class. Using this time of checking the learning status of the pupils during the lessons for other learning matter will promote the English knowledge of the class.

**vocheck offers the solution**
vocheck is an online tool which offers a solution for all these problems. The teacher of a class
just put all the vocabularies in the online system. The pupils must learn and test the vocabularies with vocheck as homework. Thus, the parents do not have to test the vocabulary of their children because the teacher sees the learning status of every pupil. The pupils have more fun learning and testing the vocabularies because they can use a fancy online tool. And the teacher does not have to check the learning progress during the lessons because he sees the progress online.
